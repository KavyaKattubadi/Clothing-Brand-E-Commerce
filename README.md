# Clothing E-commerce (MERN) - Pasovit Assignment Solution (Scaffold)

This repository contains a complete backend (Node/Express/MongoDB) and a minimal React frontend scaffold implementing the core features requested:

- User registration & login (bcrypt + JWT in HTTP-only cookie)
- Product catalog with search, filters, pagination
- Seed script with 20 products (`backend/seedProducts.js`)
- Cart model for logged-in users; guest cart via localStorage in frontend
- Mock checkout and order saving, with Nodemailer email sending (configure env)

What I included:
- A fully working backend implementation (routes, controllers, models, seeder)
- A minimal frontend that demonstrates product listing, product detail, guest cart, auth forms.
